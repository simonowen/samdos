# samdos

Source code of samdos2, the standard disk operating system for the SAM Coup√©.

### procedure
The starting point was the source code [SamDos2InCometFormatMasterv1.2.zip](http://ftp.nvg.ntnu.no/pub/sam-coupe/sources/) which contains five versions (comp1.s through comp5.s).  These five versions have been uploaded over each other with the version numbers in the files being renamed to provide source history.

comp5.s is not the final "samdos2" as was publicly distributed.

I have disassembled the samdos2 binary using dz80 and merged it into the original. Prior to merging I will standardise the original sources to keep the differences between the latest source and samdos2 visible.
